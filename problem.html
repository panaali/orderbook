<h1>Order Book Programming Problem</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p> Suppose your great aunt Gertrude dies and leaves you $3000 which you
decide you want to invest in the Acme Internet Widget Company (stock
symbol:AIWC). You are willing to pay up to $30 per share of AIWC. So you
log in to your online trading account and enter a limit order: "BUY 100
AIWC @ $30". It's a limit order because that's most you're willing to
pay. You'd be willing to pay less than $30, but not more than $30. Your
order will sit around in the market until you get your 100 shares. A
limit order to buy is called a "bid". </p>

<p> But you're not the only prospective buyer for AIWC stock. Others
want to buy it too. One is bidding $31/share for 200 shares, while
another is bidding $29/share for 300 shares. When Warren Buffett wants
to sell 225 shares, he's obviously going to take the highest price
he can get for each share. So he hits the $31 bid first, selling 200
shares. Then he sells his remaining 25 shares to you at $30/share. Your
bid size reduced by 25, leaving 75 shares still to be bought. </p>

<p> Suppose you eventually get the full 100 shares at some price. Next
year, you decide to buy a new computer and you need $4500 for it, and
luckily the value of AIWC has appreciated by 50%. So you want to sell
your 100 shares of AIWC stock for at least $45/share. So you enter this
limit order: "SELL 100 AIWC @ $45". A limit order to sell is called an
"ask". </p>

<p> But you're not the only prospective seller of AIWC stock. There's
also an ask for $44/share and an ask for $46/share. If Alan Greenspan
wants to buy AIWC, he's obviously going to pay as little as possible. So
he'll take the $44 offer first, and only buy from you at $45 if he can't
buy as much as he wants at $44. </p>

<p> The set of all standing bids and asks is called a "limit order
book", or just a "book". You can buy a data feed from the stock market,
and they will send you messages in real time telling you about changes
to the book. Each message either adds an order to the book, or reduces
the size of an order in the book (possibly removing the order entirely).
You can record these messages in a log file, and later you can go back
and analyze your log file. </p>

<h2>Problem</h2>

<p> Your task is to write a program, <i>Pricer</i>, that analyzes
such a log file. <i>Pricer</i> takes one command-line argument:
<var>target-size</var>. <i>Pricer</i> then reads a market data log
on standard input. As the book is modified, <i>Pricer</i> prints (on
standard output) the total expense you would incur if you bought
<var>target-size</var> shares (by taking as many asks as necessary,
lowest first), and the total income you would receive if you sold
<var>target-size</var> shares (by hitting as many bids as necessary,
highest first). Each time the income or expense changes, it prints the
changed value.</p>

<h3>Input Format</h3>

<p> The market data log contains one message per line (terminated by a
single linefeed character, '<code>\n</code>'), and each
message is a series of fields separated by spaces. </p>

<p>
An "Add Order to Book" message looks like this:
</p>

<p class='message'><var>timestamp</var> A <var>order-id</var> <var>side</var> <var>price</var> <var>size</var></p>

<table>
    <tr>
	<th>Field</th>
	<th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><var>timestamp</var></td>
	<td>The time when this message was generated by the market,
	as milliseconds since midnight.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><code>A</code></td>
	<td>A literal string identifying this as an "Add Order to Book"
	message.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><var>order-id</var></td>
	<td>A unique string that subsequent "Reduce Order" messages
	will use to modify this order.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><var>side</var></td>
	<td>A '<code>B</code>' if this is a buy order (a bid), and a
	'<code>S</code>' if this is a sell order (an ask).
	</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><var>price</var></td>
	<td>The limit price of this order.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><var>size</var></td>
	<td>The size in shares of this order, when it was initially sent
	to the market by some stock trader.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
A "Reduce Order" message looks like this:
</p>

<p class='message'><var>timestamp</var> R <var>order-id</var> <var>size</var></p>

<table>
    <tr>
	<th>Field</th>
	<th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><var>timestamp</var></td>
	<td>The time when this message was generated by the market,
	as milliseconds since midnight.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><code>R</code></td>
	<td>A literal string identifying this as an "Reduce Order"
	message.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><var>order-id</var></td>
	<td>The unique string that identifies the order to be reduced.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><var>size</var></td>
	<td>The amount by which to reduce the size of the order.  This
	is <em>not</em> the new size of the order.  If <var>size</var>
	is equal to or greater than the existing size of the order, the
	order is removed from the book.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p> The log file messages are sorted by timestamp by the time
<i>Pricer</i> receives them. </p>

<p> If <i>Pricer</i> encounters an error in an input message, it must print
a warning to standard error and proceed to the next message. </p>

<h3>Output Format</h3>

<p><i>Pricer</i>'s output consists of one message per line in this
format: </p>

<p class='message'><var>timestamp</var> <var>action</var> <var>total</var></p>

<table>
    <tr>
	<th>Field</th>
	<th>Meaning</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><var>timestamp</var></td>
	<td>The timestamp from the input message that caused this output
	message to be generated.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><var>action</var></td>
	<td>A string: '<code>B</code>' if this message contains the new
	expense to buy <var>target-size</var> shares, and
	'<code>S</code>' if this message contains the new income for
	selling <var>target-size</var> shares.
    </tr>
    <tr>
	<td><var>total</var></td>
	<td><p>The total expense (if <var>action</var> is '<code>B</code>')
	to buy <var>target-size</var> shares, or the total income
	(if <var>action</var> is '<code>S</code>') for selling
	<var>target-size</var> shares.</p>
	<p>If the book does not contain <var>target-size</var> shares in
	the appropriate type of order (asks for expense; bids for
	income), the <var>total</var> field contains the string
	'<code>NA</code>'. </p></td>
	</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Example Input and Output</h3>

<p> Here is an example run of <i>Pricer</i> with a <var>target-size</var>
of 200. Input messages are in the left column. Notes and output messages
are in the right column. </p>

<p>
Note that the book initially contains no orders, and that the buying
expense and selling income are both considered to start at
'<code>NA</code>'.  Since <i>Pricer</i> only produces output when the
income or expense changes, it does not print anything until the total
size of all bids or the total size of all asks meets or exceeds
<var>target-size</var>.
</p>

<h2>What We're Looking For</h2>

<p> Please write the <i>Pricer</i> program in one of C, C++, Java, or Scala, and send us the source code.
You do not need to send us any compiler output. We encourage you to take advantage of the language's
standard libraries and latest versions. Please do not use other code that you would
have to download separately from your chosen language's normal distribution package. </p>

<p> We're looking for evidence that you can produce code that others
would be able to understand, fix, and extend.  At the same time, we do
have real-time requirements for production code, so we frown on
gratuitous inefficiency.  Here are some qualities we look for:
</p>

<ul>

    <li> Correctness.  Obviously, the fewer bugs you write, the fewer
    you'll have to fix.

    <li> Clarity. If only you can understand your code, then only you
    can maintain it. Good code speaks for itself - a good programmer
    should be able to understand your implementation details without
    extensive comments.

    <li> Conciseness.  The less code you write, the less code your
    coworkers need to puzzle out.

    <li> Coefficiency. OK, just efficiency, but wouldn't it be cool if
    all of these qualities started with a 'C'? Anyway, using less time and
    space is generally better than otherwise.

</ul>

<p>
Of course, there are often trade-offs between each of these properties
(except correctness, which is pretty much an absolute).
</p>

<p> Also, we are a Linux shop and we like Unix-style tools: programs
that process the output of other programs. So make sure your
implementation of <i>Pricer</i> is suitable for use in a shell pipeline.
Follow the I/O specifications: don't mix prompts in with your output or
demand that the input come from a disk file.
</p>

<p> In addition to supplying us with your source code, please
answer these questions: </p>

<ul>
    <li> How did you choose your implementation language?
    <li> What is the time complexity for processing an Add Order
    message?
    <li> What is the time complexity for processing a Reduce Order
    message?
    <li> If your implementation were put into production and found to be
    too slow, what ideas would you try out to improve its performance?  (Other than reimplementing it in a different language such as C or C++.)
</ul>

<h2>Test Data</h2>

<p> You can download a large amount of test input data here: <a
href='./pricer.in.gz' >pricer.in.gz</a>.
This file is compressed using gzip.  You should uncompress it before
feeding it to your program.  This is real market data, collected from a
live system, so you might want to analyze it to decide what algorithms
are most appropriate to use in <i>Pricer</i>.  </p>

<p>You can also download the corresponding output of our reference implementation of
<i>Pricer</i> with various target sizes:
<a href='./pricer.out.1.gz'
>target size 1</a>, <a
href='./pricer.out.200.gz'
>target size 200</a>, <a
href='./pricer.out.10000.gz'
>target size 10000</a>.  These files are also compressed with
gzip.
</p>

<p> In case you want to test your implementation on a smaller sample of data, here is a snippet in easy-to-cut-and-paste format: </p>

<pre>
28800538 A b S 44.26 100
28800562 A c B 44.10 100
28800744 R b 100
28800758 A d B 44.18 157
28800773 A e S 44.38 100
28800796 R d 157
28800812 A f B 44.18 157
28800974 A g S 44.27 100
